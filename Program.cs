// 1. Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
//Example 1:
//Input: x = 121
//Output: true
//Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
//Example 2:
//Input: x = -121
//Output: false
//Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.



//2. Write a program in C# Sharp to create a function to calculate the sum of the individual digits of a given number.
//Test Data :
//Enter a number: 1234
//Expected Output :
//The sum of the digits of the number 1234 is : 10



//3.Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
//Example 1:
//Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
//Output: true
//Example 2:
//Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
//Output: false
//Example 3:
//Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]
//Output: true
